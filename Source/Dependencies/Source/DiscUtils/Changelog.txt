- The FileSystemManager, VirtualDiskManager can no longer auto-detect some filesystems / vdi types, as they have been separated into different assemblies (See use of SetupHelper)
- The DiscUtils.Xva library has been ported to .NET Core
- DiscUtils.Net has been reintroduced, but not ported to .NET Core

- Created Meta packages for Complete and FileSystems
- Use SetupHelper prior to using detection classes, such as PartitionTable, FileSystemManager, VirtualDisk, VolumeManager
- Meta packages ship their own SetupHelper as a convenience method

- Refactored FileSystemManager to always be static
- Moved static parts of VirtualDisk into VirtualDiskManager

- Changed codestyle from FxCop to Resharper
